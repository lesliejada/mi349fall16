        <p> Let's face it, for years blacks have faced unjust treatment whether it was mass incarceration, racial injustice, or even cultural appropriation. And get this, all because of the color of our skin. Nomorehashtags is committed to shedding light on incidents that the media refuses to cover while also allowing you, the user to interact with the black community. It is not a sight to bring you down, but lift you up. Let's become knowledgable of what is going on all while being a shoulder to lean on. If we don't look out for one another, no one else will. </p>
